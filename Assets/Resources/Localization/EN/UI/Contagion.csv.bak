You want to play with me, don't you?
Where the darkness is
You will hear something that cannot be heard
You won't see anything there, but I'll be looking at you.
It's too primitive. Not there. I don't like. Maybe you'll like it?
Fall inside. Fall into the abyss. Fall to me.
And I'll take you. Like a breath of cool wind.
You won't understand anything, you won't understand anything, but it will be in front of your nose
As soon as you look down, right in front of you, it will be right in front of you
It will fill the mind. You'll guess. It will fill your consciousness. You admit it. And then I'll tell you
The end is near
