<color=#0044FF>You want to play with me, don't you?</color>
<color=#0044FF>Where the darkness is</color>
<color=#0044FF>You will hear something that cannot be heard</color>
<color=#0044FF>You won't see anything there, but I'll be looking at you.</color>
<color=#0044FF>It's too primitive. Not there. I don't like. Maybe you'll like it?</color>
<color=#0044FF>Fall inside. Fall into the abyss. Fall to me.</color>
<color=#0044FF>And I'll take you. Like a breath of cool wind.</color>
<color=#0044FF>You won't understand anything, you won't understand anything, but it will be in front of your nose</color>
<color=#0044FF>As soon as you look down, right in front of you, it will be right in front of you</color>
<color=#0044FF>It will fill the mind. You'll guess. It will fill your consciousness. You admit it. And then I'll tell you</color>
<color=#0044FF>The end is near</color>
